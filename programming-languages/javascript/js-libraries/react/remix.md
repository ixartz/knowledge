## Notes

- [If you're using Remix you don't need react-query/Apollo/redux or even axios for making network requests. It's all handled for you + much more by the framework.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1463994662281048074)
- [Moving back to the server it makes GraphQL less interesting since you can get faster access to your db via Prisma and direct db connection.](https://twitter.com/jmarbutt/status/1464003898973339656)
- [Remix is fundamentally built from nested routes.](https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1466515470282989570)
