# [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

I now use [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://twitter.com/signalnerve/status/1449038210076655624) for exposing local services to the web (such as localhost).

## Using it

If I started my local server on port 3000. This command: `ngrok http 3000` will create a shareable link of my tunneled server.

## Notes

- [ngrok lets you inspect incoming requests in a web UI, and even replay past requests.](https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1379092674280579082)
